            <p>
                I am an experienced Business Analyst with a strong technical background and great project management skills. I am able to work on multiple projects at the same time, which over the years at Network Solutions have led to eight-digit efficiencies for the business. Furthermore, I immensely enjoy the process of deriving critical business insights using analytics, and then supporting or directly managing the efficiency implementation projects. My ability to move from analysis or leading a team of analysts to supporting or leading the actual project is something that could help further accelerate the velocity of work at Ion Insights.
